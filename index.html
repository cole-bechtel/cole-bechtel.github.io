                Hello and welcome to my website! Please enjoy the games that
                some of my friends and I have created. If you wish to learn more about me, read on.
                Currently, I am in <label for="year"></label>th grade at 
                <label for="school"></label> in upstate 
                New York. My favorite classes
                are math and band (I play the saxophone). When I was in
                3rd grade, I fell in love with computer science and 
                game development. I was taught JavaScript
                by my older brother (visit his website <a class="link"
                href = "https://owenbechtel.com" target = "_blank">here</a>) 
                and have been working on games ever since. In 6th Grade,
                I founded our school's first Coding Club with the help
                of one of my best friends. I have had so many great
                experiences teaching my classmates something I am so 
                interested in. Besides JavaScript, I am familiar with 
                Python, HTML, C#, and some C++. I am currently in the process
                learning Haskell, which I find very intriguing so far. I am
                also very fond of chess and other board games.
                Without further ado, please enjoy the assortment of games 
                and other programs I have made. Farewell!
            </p>
