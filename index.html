                Hello and welcome to my website! Please enjoy the games that
                some of my friends and I have created. If you wish to learn more about me, read on.
                Currently, I am a <label for="year">f</label> grade student at O'Rourke
                Middle School in upstate New York. My favorite classes
                are math and band (I play the saxophone). When I was in
                3rd grade, I fell in love with computer science and 
                game development. I was taught JavaScript
                by my older brother (visit his website <a class="link"
                href = "https://owenbechtel.com" target = "_blank">here</a>) 
                and have been working on games ever since. In 6th Grade,
                I founded our school's first Coding Club with the help
                of one of my best friends. I have had so many great
                experiences teaching my classmates something I am so 
                interested in. Besides JavaScript, I am familiar with 
                Python and HTML. I am planning on learning C# so that 
                I can begin developing with the Unity game engine. I am
                also very fond of chess and attend the Middle School 
                Chess Club every week. Some of my other hobbies include
                snowboarding, tennis, volleyball, and drawing.
                Without further ado, please enjoy the assortment of games 
                and other programs I have made! Goodbye!
            </p>
